The following files trees are automatically generated by a task in [verbfile.js](verbfile.js).

- [generated files](#generated-files): trees representing the actual generated "dest" files for each task
- [source files](#source-files): trees representing the source files and templates used by each task

_(See Generate's [customization docs ][docs]{customization.md} to learn how to override individual templates.)_

### Generated files

Files generated by each task (e.g. `dest` files). See the Generate [customization docs ][docs]{customization.md} to learn how to override individual templates.

Note that diffs are base on comparisons against the files generated by the `default` task. Additionally, some tasks generate the same files, but with different contents (for example, the contents of `index.js` differs based on the task).

#### default

Files generated by the [default task](#default):

```diff
 .
 └── test.js
```

#### base

Files generated by the [base task](#base):

```diff
 .
 └── test.js
```

#### generator

Files generated by the [generator task](#generator):

```diff
 .
+└─┬ test
   ├── test.js
+  └── plugin.js
```

#### updater

Files generated by the [updater task](#updater):

```diff
 .
+└─┬ test
   ├── test.js
+  └── plugin.js
```

### Source files

The following trees represent the source files or templates that are used by each task. You'll see that most of the tasks use at least one "micro-generator" to generate a specific file.

#### default

Source files and/or libraries used by the [default task](#default):

```diff
 .
 └─┬ templates
   ├── base.js
   └── test.js
```

#### base

Source files and/or libraries used by the [base task](#base):

```diff
 .
 └─┬ templates
   └── base.js
```

#### generator

Source files and/or libraries used by the [generator task](#generator):

```diff
 .
 └─┬ scaffolds
   └─┬ generator
     └─┬ templates
       ├── plugin.js
       └── test.js
```

#### updater

Source files and/or libraries used by the [updater task](#updater):

```diff
 .
 └─┬ scaffolds
   └─┬ updater
     └─┬ templates
       ├── plugin.js
       └── test.js
```
