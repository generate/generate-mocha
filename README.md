# generate-mocha [![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/generate-mocha.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generate-mocha) [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/jonschlinkert/generate-mocha.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jonschlinkert/generate-mocha)

> Generate mocha test files.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install generate-mocha --save
```

This generator is somewhat naive and opinionated at the moment. I guess it takes after me ;)

**Getting started**

If you're not already familiar with [generate](https://github.com/generate/generate), you might find generate's [getting started guide](https://github.com/generate/generate/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) useful before continuining.

## Usage

With both `generate-mocha` and `generate` installed globally, you should now be able to run this generator's default task with the following command:

```sh
$ gen mocha
```

If the generator and its task completed successfuly, you should see something like this in the terminal:

```sh
[00:44:21] starting mocha generator
[00:44:21] starting mocha:default task
[00:44:22] finished mocha:default task 63ms
[00:44:22] finished mocha generator 68ms
[00:44:22] finished ✔
```

## Extend your generator

The [usage instructions](#usage) explain how to use this as a standalone generator, but you can also use `generate-mocha` to extend your own generator, and cut down on boilerplate code needed to get up and running.

To extend your generator, add the  `.extendWith()` line inside your generator:

```js
var mocha = require('generate-mocha');

module.exports = function(app) {
  mocha.invoke(app[, options]);

  // do generator stuff
};
```

That's it! you should now be able to use any features from `generate-mocha` as if they were created in your own generator.

**Override settings**

You can override any feature or setting from `generate-mocha` by defining new values. E.g. we aren't doing any magic, the `.invoke` method just calls this generator in the context of your generator's instance.

## Advanced usage

**Lazily-extend your generator**

Run the `mocha` task to lazily add the features and settings from `generate-mocha`.

This approach offers the advantage of choosing when and where to invoke `generate-mocha` inside your own generator.

```js
module.exports = function(app) {
  app.extendWith(require('generate-mocha'));

  app.task('foo', function(cb) {
    // do task stuff
    cb();
  });

  app.task('default', ['mocha', 'foo']);
};
```

**Note that** _before running task `foo`, you MUST RUN the `mocha` task_ to get the features from `generate-mocha` loaded onto your generator's instance.
