```

## CLI

**Installing the CLI**

To run the `mocha` generator from the command line, you'll need to install [generate](https://github.com/generate/generate) globally first. You can that now with the following command:

```sh
$ npm i -g generate
```

This adds the `gen` command to your system path, allowing it to be run from any directory. Visit the [generate](https://github.com/generate/generate) project and documentation to learn more.

**Run the `mocha` generator from the command line**

Once both [generate](https://github.com/generate/generate) and `generate-mocha` are installed globally, you can run the generator with the following command:

Run the `mocha` generator from the command line:

```sh
$ gen mocha
```

## Tasks

### [generator](index.js#L84)

Generate unit tests for a [generate](https://github.com/generate/generate) generator. Creates:

* `test.js`
* `plugin.js`

**Example**

```sh
$ gen mocha:gen
# aliased as
$ gen mocha:generator
```

### [base](index.js#L97)

Generate a `test.js` file with unit tests for a [base](https://github.com/node-base/base) project.

**Example**

```sh
$ gen mocha:base
```

### [mocha:templates](index.js#L110)

Pre-load templates. This is called by the [default](#default) task, but if you call this task directly make sure it's called after collections are created.

**Example**

```sh
$ gen mocha:templates
```

### [mocha:prompt-choices](index.js#L129)

Prompt the user to save preferences and automatically use them on the next run.

**Example**

```sh
$ gen mocha:prompt-choices
```

### [mocha:post-generate](index.js#L159)

Asks if you want to use the same "post-generate" choices next time this generator is run. If you change your mind, just run `gen node:choices` and you'll be prompted again.

If `false`, the [prompt-mocha](#prompt-mocha), [prompt-npm](#prompt-npm), and [prompt-git](#prompt-git) tasks will be
run after files are generated then next time the generator is run.
If `true`, the [mocha](#mocha), [npm](#npm), and [git](#git) tasks will be run (and you will not
be prompted) after files are generated then next time the generator is run.

**Example**

```sh
$ gen mocha:post-generate
```

### [mocha:mocha](index.js#L188)

Generate a `test.js` file in the cwd or specified directory. This task is called by the default task. We alias the task as `mocha:mocha` to make it easier for other generators to run it programmatically.

**Example**

```sh
$ gen mocha:mocha
```

### [mocha:default](index.js#L214)

Alias for the [test](#test) task. Allows the generator to be run with the following command:

**Example**

```sh
$ gen mocha
```

### [mocha:unit-test](index.js#L227)

This task is used in unit tests to ensure this generator works in all intended scenarios.

**Example**

```sh
$ gen mocha:unit-test
```

## API

To use this generator as a node.js module, as a plugin or sub-generator, you must first install the generator locally.

**Install generate locally**

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install generate-mocha
```

### Usage

Then use in your project:

```js
var mocha = require('generate-mocha');
```

**Use as a plugin in your app**

In your [generate](https://github.com/generate/generate) project:

```js
var generate = require('generate');
var app = generate();

app.use(mocha);
```

**Use as a plugin in your generator**

In your [generate](https://github.com/generate/generate) generator:

```js
module.exports = function(app) {
  app.use(mocha);
};
```

**Use as a sub-generator**

In your [generate](https://github.com/generate/generate) generator:

```js
module.exports = function(app) {
  // name the sub-generator whatever you want
  app.register('foo', require('generate-mocha'));
};
```
